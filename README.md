Solving n-armed-bandit problems using different policies to find the path with the least regret. Some of the policies used in this project were policy gradient and Thompson sampling. All the environments and agents are implemented with the aid of the Amalearn library. This project was carried out as part of the  Reinforcement graduate course offered at University of Tehran under the supervision of [Prof Nili](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~mnili).
